# Chapter II
## Objectives

This project is a surprise.

As you are reaching the end of your Common Core, you have developed strong adaptation and problem-solving skills. This project will confront you with maybe-unknown technologies, intentionally.

Once again, you will have to adapt, discover, explore, experiment to create the expected software.

The project includes a mandatory part and a series of modules on various topics, as detailed below in this subject. You will be able to choose the modules you want among a large list, but each module and mandatory element contains technical constraints you cannot bypass.

So you can select the topics you like, but not technologies you like. This is a deliberate pedagogical choice.

This project is not intended to be a portfolio for an incoming internship or other professional experience. Its purpose is to reveal your ability to become acquainted with and complete a complex task using an unfamiliar technology. This situation will inevitably be faced during your career, and we aim to develop your self-confidence in front of such situations.

Especially on this big and long project, we encourage you to carefully read the entire subject, consider several possible strategies, think about your design, before starting coding anything!

Some modules may depend on others, some modules may conflict with others. Ft_transcendence will bring many doubts and requires a lot of difficult decisions! Act wisely :-)

Also, this project is definitely a long run, and a wrong path will lead you to a huge loss of time. Your project management and team management choices will strongly impact your timeline and results. Many approaches and tools exist to support you on these topics.

Good luck, and have fun playing Pong!

# Chapter III
## AI Instructions

**Context**
During your learning journey, AI can assist with many different tasks. Take the time to explore the various capabilities of AI tools and how they can support your work. However, always approach them with caution and critically assess the results. Whether it's code, documentation, ideas, or technical explanations, you can never be completely sure that your question was well-formed or that the generated content is accurate. Your peers are a valuable resource to help you avoid mistakes and blind spots.

**Main message**
* Use AI to reduce repetitive or tedious tasks.
* Develop prompting skills both coding and non-coding that will benefit your future career.
* Learn how AI systems work to better anticipate and avoid common risks, biases, and ethical issues.
* Continue building both technical and power skills by working with your peers.
* Only use AI-generated content that you fully understand and can take responsibility for.

**Learner rules:**
* You should take the time to explore AI tools and understand how they work, so you can use them ethically and reduce potential biases.
* You should reflect on your problem before prompting this helps you write clearer, more detailed, and more relevant prompts using accurate vocabulary.
* You should develop the habit of systematically checking, reviewing, questioning, and testing anything generated by AI.
* You should always seek peer review don't rely solely on your own validation.

**ft_transcendence Phase outcomes:**
* Develop both general-purpose and domain-specific prompting skills.
* Boost your productivity with effective use of AI tools.
* Surprise.
* Continue strengthening computational thinking, problem-solving, adaptability, and collaboration.

**Comments and examples:**
* You'll regularly encounter situations — exams, evaluations, and more — where you must demonstrate real understanding. Be prepared, keep building both your technical and interpersonal skills.
* Explaining your reasoning and debating with peers often reveals gaps in your understanding. Make peer learning a priority.
* AI tools often lack your specific context and tend to provide generic responses. Your peers, who share your environment, can offer more relevant and accurate insights.
* Where AI tends to generate the most likely answer, your peers can provide alternative perspectives and valuable nuance. Rely on them as a quality checkpoint.

**Good practice:**
I ask AI: "How do I test a sorting function?" It gives me a few ideas. I try them out and review the results with a peer. We refine the approach together.

**X Bad practice:**
I ask AI to write a whole function, copy-paste it into my project. During peer-evaluation, I can't explain what it does or why. I lose credibility and I fail my project.

**Good practice:**
I use AI to help design a parser. Then I walk through the logic with a peer. We catch two bugs and rewrite it together better, cleaner, and fully understood.

**X Bad practice:**
I let Copilot generate my code for a key part of my project. It compiles, but I can't explain how it handles pipes. During the evaluation, I fail to justify and I fail my project.

# Chapter IV
## Mandatory part

This project is about creating a website for the mighty Pong contest!

### IV.1 Overview

Your software will offer a nice user interface and real-time multiplayer capabilities allowing to play Pong with all your friends!

* At first, your project needs to adhere to the mandatory guidelines as a minimum requirement (see next section), which will represent only a small portion to the final grade.
* The second part of this subject will offer additional modules that can replace or complement the mandatory part.

> In this subject, you will face words that are highlighted in green. They represent technology choices that will evolve over time. Be sure to pay close attention to the version of the subject.

> !
> * The use of libraries or tools that provide an immediate and complete solution for an entire feature or a module is prohibited.
> * Any direct instruction regarding the use (can, must, can't) of a third-party library or tool must be followed.
> * The use of a small library or tool that solves a simple, unique task representing a subcomponent of a larger feature or module, is allowed.
> * During the evaluation, the team will justify any use of library or tool that is not explicitly approved by the project guidelines and is not in contradiction with the project's constraints.
> * During the evaluation, the evaluator will take responsibility for determining whether the use of a specific library or tool is legitimate (and allowed) or if it essentially solves an entire feature or module (and is therefore prohibited).

### IV.2 Minimal technical requirement

Your project must comply with the following rules:

> i
> Some of these constraints may be overridden by the choice of specific modules.

* You are free to develop the site, with or without a backend. If you choose to include a backend, it must be written in pure PHP without frameworks. However, this requirement can be overridden by the **Framework** module. If your backend or framework uses a database, you must follow the constraints of the **Database** module.
* The frontend should be developed using **Typescript** as base code. However, this requirement can be modified through the **FrontEnd** module.
* Your website must be a single-page application. The user should be able to use the Back and Forward buttons of the browser.
* Your website must be compatible with the latest stable up-to-date version of **Mozilla Firefox**. Of course, it can be compatible with other web browsers!
* The user should encounter no unhandled errors or warnings when browsing the website.
* You must use Docker to run your website. Everything must be launched with a single command line to run an autonomous container.

> !
> Several container technologies exist: Docker, containerd, podman, etc. On the computers of your campus, you may access the container software in rootless mode for security reasons. This could lead to the following extra constraints:
> * Your runtime needs to be located in /goinfre or /sgoinfre.
> * You are not able to use "bind-mount volumes" between the host and the container if non-root UIDs are used in the container.
> * Depending on the current requirements of the subject (highlighted in green above) and the local configuration in clusters, you may need to adopt different strategies, such as: container solution in virtual machine, rebuild your container after your changes, craft your own image with root as unique UID.

### IV.3 Game

Surprise.
The main purpose of this website is to play Pong versus other players.

* Users must be able to participate in a live Pong game against another player directly on the website. Both players will use the same keyboard. The **Remote players** module can enhance this functionality with remote players.
* A player must be able to play against another, and a tournament system should also be available. This tournament will consist of multiple players who can take turns playing against each other. You have flexibility in how you implement the tournament, but it must clearly display who is playing against whom and the order of the play.
* A registration system is required: at the start of a tournament, each player must input their alias. The aliases will be reset when a new tournament begins. However, this requirement can be modified using the **Standard User Management** module.
    * Note: This does not imply user account creation. In the default (mandatory) version, users simply enter an alias manually.
* There must be a matchmaking system: the tournament system should organize the matchmaking of the participants, and announce the next match.
* All players must adhere to the same rules, including having identical paddle speed. This requirement also applies when using AI; the AI must exhibit the same speed as a regular player.
* The game must adhere to the default frontend constraints (as outlined above), or you may choose to use the **FrontEnd** module, or override it with the **Graphics** module. While the visual aesthetics can vary, the game must still capture the essence of the original Pong (1972).

> !
> * The use of libraries or tools that provide an immediate and complete solution for an entire feature or module is prohibited.
> * Any direct instruction regarding the use (can, must, can't) of a third-party library or tool must be followed.
> * The use of a small library or tool that solves a simple, unique task, representing a subcomponent of a larger feature or module, is allowed.
> * During the evaluation, the team will justify any use of a library or tool that is not explicitly approved by the project guidelines and is not in contradiction with the project's constraints.
> * During the evaluation, the evaluator will determine whether the use of a specific library or tool is legitimate (and allowed) or if it essentially solves an entire feature or module (and is therefore prohibited).
> * The tournament system must work with or without user registration.
>     * Without the **Standard User Management** module: users manually input an alias.
>     * With the module: aliases are linked to registered accounts, allowing persistent stats and friend lists. The module extends the tournament logic; it does not replace it.

### IV.4 Security concerns

Surprise.
In order to create a functional website, there are several security concerns you must address:

* Any password stored in your database, if applicable, must be hashed.
* Your website must be protected against SQL injections/XSS attacks.
* If you have a backend or any other features, it is mandatory to enable an HTTPS connection for all aspects (use wss instead of ws for example).
* You must implement validation mechanisms for forms and any user input, either on the base page if no backend is used, or on the server side if a backend is employed.
* Regardless of whether you choose to implement the **JWT Security** module with **2FA**, it's essential to prioritize the security of your website. For instance, if you choose to create an API, ensure your routes are protected. Even if you decide not to use JWT tokens, securing the site remains critical.

> !
> Please make sure you use a strong password hashing algorithm.
> For obvious security reasons, any credentials, API keys, env variables etc., must be saved locally in a env file and ignored by git.
> Publicly stored credentials will cause your project to fail.

# Chapter V
## Modules

Now that you've accomplished 25% of the project, congratulations!
With a functional basic website in place, the next step is to choose modules for further improvement.
To achieve 100% project completion, a minimum of 7 major modules is required.
It's crucial to carefully review each module as it may require modifications to your baseline website. Therefore, we strongly recommend reading this entire subject thoroughly.

> !
> * The use of libraries or tools that provide an immediate and complete solution for an entire feature or module is prohibited.
> * Any direct instructions regarding the use (can, must, can't) of a third-party library or tool must be followed.
> * The use of a small library or tool that solves a simple, unique task, representing a subcomponent of a larger feature or module, is allowed.
> * During the evaluation, the team will justify any usage of library or tool that is not explicitly approved by the subject, and that does not contradict the subject's constraints.
> * During the evaluation, the evaluator will determine whether the use of a specific library or tool is legitimate (and allowed) or if it essentially solves an entire feature or module (and is therefore prohibited).
